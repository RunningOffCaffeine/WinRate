This script is intended to be used alongside Limbus Company on PC.

This script automates most actions, from auto battling*
to dialogue skips.
*(Auto battling is defined as selecting Win Rate option in batle)

This program does not give any unfair advantage, it simply automates
already present functions of the game.
